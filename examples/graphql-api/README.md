# zuplo-graphql-example

At Zuplo, we're passionate about empowering developers build robust, scalable, and dynamic applications. That's why we love GraphQL!

## Live demo & Example

It's deployed on Zuplo, so you can check out the live demo here:

https://graphlq-example-main-062e49c.zuplo.app/

Checkout the [config/routes.oas.json](./config/routes.oas.json) to learn how to setup GraphQL with Zuplo and the [config/policies.json](./config/policies.json) on how to configure the GraphQL policies.

## What's in this example?

This example demonstrates how to use Zuplo's GraphQL API Gateway with a GraphQL API. The example demonstrates the following things:

- Adding a depth limit to your GraphQL API
- Adding a query cost / complexity limit to your GraphQL API

### Depth Limit

A depth limit allows you to limit the depth of GraphQL queries. This is useful to prevent malicious queries that could cause a denial of service attack on your GraphQL API.

### Query Cost Limit

Using the query cost limit, you can limit the cost of GraphQL queries. This is useful to prevent malicious queries that could cause a denial of service attack on your GraphQL API.
