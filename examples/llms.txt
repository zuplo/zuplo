# Zuplo Examples

> API gateway examples demonstrating Zuplo features including rate limiting, caching, authentication, MCP servers, and custom policies.

## Quick Start

Each example can be run locally:
```bash
cd {example-name}
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or create a fresh copy:
```bash
npx create-zuplo-api@latest --example {example-name}
```

## Documentation

## Starter Examples

These examples are great starting points for new projects:
- [basic-api-gateway](./basic-api-gateway/): Protect your backend API with authentication, rate limiting, and request validation
- [dev-portal-with-api-keys](./dev-portal-with-api-keys/): Let developers sign up and create their own API keys through a self-serve portal
- [remote-mcp-server-with-oauth](./remote-mcp-server-with-oauth/): Secure your MCP Server with OAuth authentication using Auth0

## Examples by Category

### MCP Servers
- [mcp-server-custom-tools](./mcp-server-custom-tools/): Create AI tools that combine multiple API calls into a single action
- [mcp-server-graphql](./mcp-server-graphql/): Make your GraphQL API available to AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT
- [mcp-server-openai-apps-sdk](./mcp-server-openai-apps-sdk/): Build a ChatGPT App that connects to your API using MCP
- [mcp-server-prompts](./mcp-server-prompts/): Improve AI assistant interactions by adding guided prompts to your MCP Server
- [remote-mcp-server](./remote-mcp-server/): Expose your API to AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT with built-in security
- [remote-mcp-server-with-oauth](./remote-mcp-server-with-oauth/): Secure your MCP Server with OAuth authentication using Auth0

### Caching
- [semantic-caching](./semantic-caching/): Reduce AI API costs by caching responses for semantically similar queries
- [idempotency-keys](./idempotency-keys/): Prevent duplicate API requests and ensure safe retries for payments and critical operations

### Authentication & Authorization
- [bff-auth](./bff-auth/): Secure your web app by handling authentication server-side without exposing tokens to the browser
- [dev-portal-with-api-keys](./dev-portal-with-api-keys/): Let developers sign up and create their own API keys through a self-serve portal
- [openfga](./openfga/): Implement fine-grained authorization with relationship-based access control

### Routing
- [environment-routing](./environment-routing/): Route requests to sandbox or production backends based on API key metadata, like Stripe
- [basic-api-gateway](./basic-api-gateway/): Protect your backend API with authentication, rate limiting, and request validation

### Rate Limiting
- [custom-429-response](./custom-429-response/): Customize the error response users see when they hit your API rate limits
- [dynamic-rate-limits](./dynamic-rate-limits/): Set different rate limits based on user subscription tier or API key metadata

### Programmability
- [custom-module](./custom-module/): Use npm packages and third-party libraries in your Zuplo handlers and policies
- [log-request-response](./log-request-response/): Debug API issues by capturing full request and response bodies in your logs
- [rewrite-request-body](./rewrite-request-body/): Transform request bodies before forwarding to your backend API
- [route-custom-data](./route-custom-data/): Add custom metadata to routes and use it in your policies and handlers
- [oas-base-path](./oas-base-path/): Remove or rewrite URL paths when forwarding requests to your backend

### Validation & Governance
- [api-linting](./api-linting/): Enforce API design standards and consistency across your team with automated linting
- [schema-validation-file-ref](./schema-validation-file-ref/): Validate requests against JSON schemas stored in separate files

### Testing
- [test-mocks](./test-mocks/): Test your Zuplo handlers and policies with mocked request and context objects
