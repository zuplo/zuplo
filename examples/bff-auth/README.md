# Backend for Frontend (BFF) Authorization Sample

This is the source code from the sample discussed in the [Backend for Frontend (BFF) Authorization blog post](https://zuplo.com/blog/2023/09/11/backend-for-frontend-authorization). 

## Setup

This sample uses an OAuth identity provider (tested with Auth0) and Upstash. In order to run the sample you will need to set the following environment variables either in your `.env` file if you are running locally or in the [Zuplo portal](https://zuplo.com/docs/articles/environment-variables#:~:text=Environment%20variables%20are%20key%2Dvalue,configuration%20files%20in%20your%20project.) if you are running there.

```
