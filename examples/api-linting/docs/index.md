# Getting Started

Simply follow the docs to understand which endpoints exist and how to call them. No authentication is required.

## JSON Placeholder

This API makes extensive use of the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API. Zuplo is used to built convenience functions on top of the base API to make for a better developer experience.

## What is Zuplo?

[Zuplo](https://zuplo.com/) is a fully-managed, serverless API edge gateway. You can add rate-limiting, authentication as fast as you can commit to git. Additionally, you can automatically generate a stripe-quality developer portal (which you are looking at right now).
