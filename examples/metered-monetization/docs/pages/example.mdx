# Metered Monetization with OpenMeter

In order to enable a flexible approach to monetizing an API we recommend using [OpenMeter](https://openmeter.io/) to handle metering, customer tracking, subscription plans and invoicing.

To enable you to create a seamless experience with Zuplo and OpenMeter we have an OpenMeter Metering Policy that allows you to store any metered events as well as ensure that customers who are at or over limit of their allowed plans, cannot continue to make requests.

This example demonstrates using our OpenMeter policy to track API requests. Additionally, it includes an integration between the built-in Zuplo Dev Portal and OpenMeter that allows users to self-serve sign up, be assigned a limited free plan for their API requests, and create API keys.

## Prerequisites

### OpenMeter Account
To work with this example you will need an OpenMeter account. You can sign up for their [free cloud based account](https://openmeter.io/pricing), or use the [self-hosted version](https://github.com/openmeterio/openmeter) on infrastructure of your choice (including Docker and Kubernetes).

### Zuplo Account
We recommend that you deploy this example to your Zuplo account, however working with the code locally will give you the most flexibility. To get a local copy follow these steps:

1. Deploy this example to your Zuplo account
2. Connect the new project to GitHub
3. Clone the GitHub repository for the project to your local machine
4. Connect the local project and the cloud based project by running the `zuplo link` command

## Setting up OpenMeter

This project includes an automated setup script that will configure the necessary OpenMeter resources for you. Follow these steps:

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Before running the setup script, you'll need to configure your OpenMeter API key. Copy the `env.example` file to create your `.env` file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file and set your OpenMeter API key:

```bash
OPENMETER_API_KEY=your_actual_openmeter_api_key_here
OPENMETER_URL=https://openmeter.cloud  # or your self-hosted URL
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Setup Script

```bash
npm run setup
```

This script will:
- Create a meter with slug `api_requests_total`
- Create a new feature for `api_requests` that users are given access to
- Create a new free plan for users to be subscribed to by default with a limit of 10 requests

The script is idempotent, so you can run it multiple times safely. If the meter already exists, it will skip creation and notify you.

If you would prefer to set this up manually in OpenMeter, you can do so and skip running this script.

## Setup Environment Variables

Once your OpenMeter instance is set up to work with this example, you can configure the rest of the environment variables.

- **`OPENMETER_FEATURE_KEY`**: The feature key that defines what you're metering (e.g., "api-requests")
- **`OPENMETER_SOURCE`**: Source identifier for your metering events (e.g., "zuplo-api")
- **`OPENMETER_URL`**: OpenMeter API URL (defaults to `https://openmeter.cloud` for cloud accounts)
- **`API_KEY_SERVICE_BUCKET_NAME`**: Zuplo bucket name for storing API key data
- **`ZUPLO_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`**: Your Zuplo deployment name (used by the docs portal)
- **`ZUPLO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`**: Your Zuplo server URL (used by the docs portal)

## Gateway Configuration

### The API
This example uses our Todo List API as a base. It's a simple CRUD API that allows users to create, update, and delete Todos and it centered around a mock API.

### OpenMeter Metering Policy

This example includes a pre-configured OpenMeter metering policy in `config/policies.json`. The policy is already set up to:

1. **Track API requests**: Automatically meter each request that passes through your gateway
2. **Extract customer information**: Use the API key metadata to identify customers
3. **Send metering data**: Forward usage data to OpenMeter for tracking and billing

The policy runs on the POST and GET routes, but not on DELETE (but you're welcome to add it).

The configuration for OpenMeter in `policies.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "openmeter-metering-inbound",
  "policyType": "openmeter-metering-inbound",
  "handler": {
    "export": "OpenMeterMeteringInboundPolicy",
    "module": "$import(@zuplo/runtime)",
    "options": {
      "apiKey": "$env(OPENMETER_API_KEY)",
      "customerIdPropertyPath": ".data.openmeter.subjectId",
      "eventType": "request",
      "meterValue": 1,
      "source": "$env(OPENMETER_SOURCE)",
      "url": "$env(OPENMETER_URL)/api/v1/events"
    }
  }
}
```

### Identifying Users for Metering

In this example, when a user creates an API key the `openmeter.subjectId` is added to the metadata for each API key.

This allows the OpenMeter Metering policy to correctly identify the user and meter against their OpenMeter Subject ID regardless of whether the API key is used in the Dev Portal, an HTTP testing tool such as HTTPie, or in another application.

This implementation is just an example as there are multiple places that the identifier for a subject could be stored and retrieved.

## The Setup So Far

At this point you have:

- Setup OpenMeter
- Added the necessary OpenMeter elements by running `npm run setup`
- Setup your environment variables

Now it's time to test everything locally.

## Running Locally
Start the servers for the API gateway and developer portal by running:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run docs
```

To test that everything is set up correctly, load the developer portal by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
